Semestral work in C++. The application simulates basic principles of relational databases in the backend and is tested in a very basic fighter game that is doing simple CRUD operations.

# What I Learned

* Fixing somewhat complicated memory leaks using debugger in Visual Studio.
* Custom implementation of exception class.
* Linking library with run application.
* Further practice of working with C++ language without libraries.
